### About
This repository contains two oTree apps:

* **one**: discrmination task between a two-digits number on the screen and a benchmark (e.g., 55) as in the experiments by Dehaene, Dupoux, and Mehler (1990), "Is Numerical Comparison Digital? Analogical and Symbolic Effects in Two-Digit Number Comparison," Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 16,(3): 626

* **two**: discrmination task between two two-digits numbers on the screen

This app was developed with oTree version 3.3.11.
