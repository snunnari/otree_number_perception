        <p>In this study, you will see a series of pairs of numbers and will be asked to classify
            <b><font color="red">what is the larger number in each pair</font></b>. If the number displayed on the left is larger than the other,
            press the “Z” key. If the number displayed on the right is larger than the other, press the "?" key.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Your bonus payment will depend on the speed and accuracy of your classification. Specifically:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><center>Bonus Payment = $ (1.5 x accuracy – 1 x speed)</center></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>where "accuracy" is the percentage of trials where you correctly classified the larger number in the pair,
            and "speed" is the average amount of time it takes you to classify the numbers on all trials throughout the study, in seconds.</p>

            <p>Thus, you make the most money by answering
            as <b><font color="red">quickly</font></b> and as <b><font color="red">accurately</font></b> as possible.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For example, if you correctly classified the numbers on all trials and it took you 0.3 seconds to respond to each question,
        you would earn $(1.5 x 100% - 10 x 0.3) = $1.20. If instead you only classified 70% of the numbers correctly and took 0.8 seconds
            to respond to each question, you would earn $(1.5 x 70% - 10 x 0.8) = $0.25.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The study will be separated into 2 parts of 50 trials each. In between, you can take a short
        break.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b><font color="red">Please read the instructions on this page carefully!</font></b> Before starting with the classification task, you will be asked a question to check your understanding of the instructions.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When you are ready to continue, press ENTER.</p>
